## Welcome to the Missoula Civic Hackathon wiki!

This is a shared notebook for ideas related to Civic Hackathons and
the Upcoming 2016 Missoula Civic Hackathon.

Contributing to the wiki is one good way for us all to move this
forward collaboratively.

Join the [[Mailing List]]. Help contribute to our survey of what other
[[Hackathons]] have done and are doing. Share some [[Datasets]] that
could be useful. Check out the proposed [[Projects]] and suggest a new
one. See who our [[Sponsors]] are and help recruit some more. Or check
out our [[Planning]] page with notes for the event such as meal plans
and budgets.

As this is a wiki, learn about [[Editing This Wiki]] and add any pages
you'd like to see.

Happy Hacking!

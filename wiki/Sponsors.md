## Sponsorship for the 2016 Missoula Civic Hackathon

### Sponsorship Opportunities

There is always room for more sponsors for this event. If you have a
business that would like to be part of helping this event please send
an email to [William Halliburton](mailto:will@blueskystewardship.org)
with your ideas.

We are still in need of sponsors for prizes. If you have a techinical
service to bring to the table, you can offer a prize for the best use
of that service. Get a cool app using your service in the public eye
and help out the hackathon.

### Food :meat_on_bone: :stew: :bread: :coffee: :tea: :apple:

[Blue Sky Stewardship](http://blueskystewardship.org), under
[MIST](http://strans.org), is a 501(c)3 certified organization and,
with enough lead-time, qualified to get event donations from many
businesses around town. If we can swarm the on-the-ground footwork.

Business around town get called daily asking for donations, so better
to visit the business in person. If you visit any of the following
businesses that are not checked off, stop off at the customer service
desk or ask the manager for their event donation policy and sign us
up!

Feel free to add businesses that we should approach.
